Nobody reads a “readme” for skyboxes, so I might as well make this my artist statement.


Artist Statement:


These four skyboxes are my first in a series of artistic game assets reflecting my vision of a game world. I’m an old-school oil painter and a card-carrying nerd. A gamer since the glory days of the Atari 2600, I have recurring dreams of being a character in my own video game. I’m currently developing the art style for an urban fantasy world. The goal is to produce beautiful and efficient assets that work for a wide range of game genres. If you enjoy these skyboxes, please rate it and leave a comment. Tell me what works, what doesn't and what you’d like to see more of.


Newdawn: Good for an ending or cutscene, very painterly. I decided to leave it very sketchy. Open. A new beginning. 


Doomsday: Good for a Silent Hill type suspense, horror, moody af, this sky was featured in my 2014 oil painting The Hermit.


Urbanlight: There is nothing like that New York City light pollution blotting out all but The One Star in Sight.


Nostalgia: If you know the 16-bit title that inspired this sky, leave a comment. 




If you read this far, thank you for your time. Now go make a game!


Sincerely,
